## Overview

I design systems that remove manual work from healthcare operations.

At the Montana Department of Public Health and Human Services, I have:

- Automated Medicaid repayment processing for 4,000+ individuals using Python and Pandas  
- Migrated over 50 years of historical records into Snowflake with SQL and Python  
- Converted manual government workflows into automated ServiceNow PDF pipelines  
- Built analytics dashboards that surfaced systemic inefficiencies and reduced processing time  

My work centers on operational analytics, automation at scale, and healthcare system modernization.

Here on GitHub, I publish architecture-focused case studies and analytics projects that demonstrate complete workflows:

**ingestion → cleaning → modeling → analysis → dashboards → automation**

## Professional Philosophy

I focus on systems, scale, and outcomes.

When I approach a problem, I look for:

- where data enters the organization  
- where work becomes manual  
- where delays or errors accumulate  
- how automation and analytics can remove friction  

I prefer measurable impact over tooling for its own sake.
